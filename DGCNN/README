The DGCNN.zip comprises of the datasets used in our paper. 
The structure of each dataset file is the following:

1st row: Overall number of graphs in the dataset (e.g., 3680)

2nd row: Number of nodes in the i graph (n) and label of ith graph (e.g., 110 1)

n rows: node id number of links connected to node nodes connected to that node, attributes of that node.
.
.
.
. 

n+i+2 row: Number of nodes in the second graph and label of first graph
...
...

Example of one (1) node instance:
26 1 85 0.495495 0.730000 0.085271 0.400000 0.750000 0.500000 0.666667 0.102564 0.333333 0.000000000
The data in this row signify that node with id = 26 is connected to 1 node, node with id = 85. The attributes of node 26 are the following:
(0.495495 0.730000 0.085271 0.400000 0.750000 0.500000 0.666667 0.102564 0.333333 0.000000000)



An example of a dataset file with this structure is presented below:
2
5 0
0 0 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 
1 1 3 0.500000 0.700000 0.300000 
2 2 3 4 1.000000 0.6500000 0.400000 
3 2 1 2 0.400000 0.300000 0.200000 
4 1 2 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 
5 1
0 0 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 
1 1 2 0.400000 0.200000 0.100000 
2 1 1 0.700000 0.300000 0.500000 
3 0 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 
4 0 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 

In this example, the dataset consists of two (2) graphs. The first graph has five (5) nodes, and the graph is labeled as zero(0) for the classification problem. 
In this graph, node with id=1 is connected to node with id=3 and node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4. Further, all connections are bidirectional (i.e., if node i is connected to node j, then node j is also connected to node i).
Regarding the feature attributes, each node has 3 feature attributes in this example. For instance, the attributes of node 1 are: 0.500000 0.700000 0.300000.
Similarly, the second graph has 5 nodes, and the graph is labeled as one(1). In this case, node 1 is connected to node 2. Also, the feature attributes of node 1 are: 0.400000 0.200000 0.100000.



Finally, test_train_idx folder has the training and testing instances used for each connection.

This structure of the dataset files was selected in order for the algorithm proposed in:
"Zhang, Muhan and Cui, Zhicheng and Neumann, Marion and Chen, Yixin, 'An End-to-End Deep Learning Architecture for Graph Classification, Proc. AAAI, 2018'" to work.
